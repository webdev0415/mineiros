# terraform-github-team

A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) 0.12 that offers a more convenient and tested way to provision and manage
[GitHub teams](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/organizing-members-into-teams).

> This Module uses `for, for-each and dynamic nested blocks` that were introduced in Terraform 0.12.
> A common problem in Terraform configurations for versions 0.11 and earlier is dealing with situations where the number
> of values or resources is decided by a dynamic expression rather than a fixed count.
> You can now dynamically add and remove items from and to Lists without the necessity to render the whole list of
> resources again. Terraform will only add and remove the items you want it to.

## Module Versioning
This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).

Using the given version number of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we apply the following constructs:
1) Use the `MAJOR` version for incompatible changes.
2) Use the `MINOR` version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
3) Use the `PATCH` version when introducing backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version
- In the context of initial development, backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is 
  increased. (Initial development)
- In the context of pre-release, backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is
increased. (Pre-release)
